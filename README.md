# bandmate
The first website I built that is meant for musicians. It's a way for musicians to meet up with other musicans in order to improve, form a band, or whatever they would like. Also a way for musicians to find teachers in their area. It is moreso of a prototype of this website but I'm proud of it as my first website.
